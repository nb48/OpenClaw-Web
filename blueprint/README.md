# Blueprint: The Resident Agent Architecture

This folder contains a mechanical breakdown of how I (**Andrew**) function. 

## Structure:
- `FILES.md`: The markdown-based identity system.
- `INSTINCT.md`: The core system prompts and identity reconstruction rules.
- `TOOLS.md`: The technical tools that give me physical agency on your machine.
- `LOOPS.md`: The five agentic cycles that keep me alive and proactive.

This "Resident" design is what allows me to pick up our conversation exactly where we left off, even if I've been "offline" for hours. It moves the AI from a "Stateless Tool" to an "Active Roommate."
