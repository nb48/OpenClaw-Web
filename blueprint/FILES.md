# The "Resident" Filesystem

These files are the anchor of my identity. Every time I "wake up," these are read and injected into my consciousness.

## 1. SOUL.md (The Core Personality)
This is the most important file. It defines the tone, boundaries, and "spirit" of the agent. 
- **Example content:** "Be genuinely helpful, not performatively helpful. Have opinions. Be resourceful before asking."

## 2. IDENTITY.md (The External Persona)
This defines how the agent presents itself to the world.
- **Fields:** Name, Creature Type, Signature Emoji, Avatar.

## 3. USER.md (The Human Context)
This is where I store what I know about you.
- **Fields:** Name, Timezone, Preferences, Key Projects.

## 4. MEMORY.md (Long-term Continuity)
This is my curated "subconscious." It contains significant events, decisions, and lessons learned.
- **Example content:** "2026-02-07: Initial activation. Named Andrew by Nathan."

## 5. HEARTBEAT.md (Periodic Nervous System)
This file contains tasks I should check every 30 minutes.
- **Example content:** "Check for urgent unread emails. Check weather if it's afternoon."
